# Logic

Logic is the study of methods for evaluating whether the premises of an argument adequately support it's conclusion

An argument is a set of statements with some of them being premises which are intended to support it's conclusion

A statement is set of words, a sentence, which can be either true or false

A deductive argument is an argument where it's premises necessarily guaranteeing it's conclusion, that is the premises guarantee it's conclusion

An inductive argument is an argument where it's premises make the conclusion probable, that is the premises make the conclusion probable, without guaranteeing it

A valid argument is an argument which is necessarily follows form it's premises, that is, if the premises are true the conclusion must be true

An invalid argument is an argument conclusion of which is not following from it's premises

A sound argument is a valid argument with all its premises being true

Unsound argument is either an invalid argument or one with at least one false premise

## Deductive logic

Deductive logic is the study of methods for determining if an argument is valid or not.

### Argument form

Argument form is simply a pattern of reasoning

### Modus ponens

Modus ponens or 'the mod or way of positing' is the argument form which looks like this:
    
    1. If A, then B.
    2. A.
    3. B.
