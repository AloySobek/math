# Euclid elements

My plan is to learn the Euclid elements book thoroughly. Ideally I want to understand and memorize all the definitions, postulates and notes, I will call them axioms.

## How

In order to comprehend the subject better I will write a special 'engine' using OpenGL(or something else, doesn't matter) which I will use to visualize all this axioms and prepositions.

## Why

The Euclid elements books are, without a doubt, a very influential mathematical book, which existed for more than 2000 years and it is still a fundamental work which teaches us geometry.

By visualizing all the prepositions of the books I hope to see them from another angle, also I hope that it can help other people to study the work of Euclid in fun, non-boring manner.
