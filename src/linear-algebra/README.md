# Linear algebra

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics concerning linear equations, linear maps and their representation in vector spaces

## Why

My goal in this project is to deepen my understanding of the subject.
I'm gonna use the work of a famous mathematician - Gilbert Strang as a starting point.
His book and the MIT lectures present the foundation of linear algebra.
I'm also gonna try to express the ideas and core concepts from those sources as I understand them myself.
I believe in the power of peer to peer teaching methods. Even though I'm not a professional mathematician,
    I will provide my own understanding of the subject, and hopefully, somebody may find it useful in their
    own journey into this beautiful world of linear algebra and the body of mathematics itself.

## Project value

This project is probably worth nothing in terms of production ready software.
There are multiple battle-tested math libraries out there.
They implement pretty much everything you need in your project, take a look at the GLM(OpenGL Mathematics) for example.
